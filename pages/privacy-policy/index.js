                consider that your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms

                In case you suspect a breach of data protection legislation in
                processing of your personal data and the matter is not solved

              <p>
                If we learn that we have inadvertently gathered personal data
                from a child under 15, we will take reasonable measures to
                promptly remove that data from our records.

              <h2>9- PRIVACY POLICIES OF LINKED THIRD-PARTY SERVICES</h2>

              <p>
                Our platform may contain links to third-party services, which
                are companies other than the two co-founders of OIFA that may
                link to their own websites, online services or applications. We
                are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of
                these third-party services. If you have any questions about how
                these third-party services use your information, you should
                review their policies and contact them directly.

              <h2>10- HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
              <p>
                We will not retain your personal data for longer than is
                necessary for the defined purpose of the processing of personal
                data or for legal requirements. For instance, we may retain some
                information for a few years after you have closed your Account
                if this is necessary to meet our legal obligations or to
                exercise, defend or establish legal rights. Certain record, for
                example those relating to payments, will be retained for
                accounting purposes for six years after the end of the year
                during which the financial year ended. Information that is not
                under legal obligation to be retained will be destroyed 2 years
                after the deletion of the account.{" "}

              <h2>11- SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
              <p>
                We implement technical and organisational security measures to
                help protect the security of your personal data both online and
                offline. We take steps to ensure that your personal data is
                treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
                These measures vary based upon the sensitivity of your data.
                Your Account information is protected by the password you use to
                access your Account. It is important that you protect and
                maintain your Account's security and that you immediately tell
                us of any unauthorised use or suspected unauthorised use of your
                Account. If you forget the password to your Account, OIFA allows
                you to request that instructions be sent to you that explain how
                to reset your password.
